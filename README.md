Showcase of Android camera control and OpenCV image processing

Features
------
Use OpenCV 3 with Android for in stream image processing.
Camera control with autofocus management, acceleration tracking, ambient light measurement and sounds on specific camera events like focus and shutter.

Several OpenCV processing examples with configuration interface:
* Channel separation for HSV and RGB colorspace 
* Grayscale histogram equalize and normalize
* Adaptive threshold binarization
* Canny Edge Detector
* Sharpen image with unsharpen mask
* Movement detection using background subtraction
* Haar cascade classifiers
* OCR (experimental)
